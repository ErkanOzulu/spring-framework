    /**Named Queries - this way isn't  preferred very much

     To make developerâ€™s life easier, Spring Data JPA provides the concept of named
     queries that can be defined by using a properties file, annotations, or an XML
     file. You can group related queries in one place and refer them in your code by
     their names. Spring Data JPA will take care of all the boilerplate code required to
     execute these queries.
     * create a Directory under resources and named "META-INF" and below create a file "jpa-named-queries.properties" and declare quires in here
